##**VeriTran's Code Exercise**

Your mission is to create a simple banking system. Think about your personal bank account experience. When in doubt, go for the simplest solution. You donâ€™t need to create any kind of user interface or make these features available through any server.

The exercise evolves as a sequence of iterations. Try to complete each iteration before reading the next one.

##**Iteration 1: Add the deposit feature**

class Account():
  def __init__(self, account_id, client_id, balance = 100):
    self.account_id = account_id
    self.client_id = client_id
    self.balance = balance

  def deposit(self, amount):
    self.amount = amount
    self.balance = self.balance + self.amount

  def check_balance(self):
    print("Account balance:", self.balance, "USD")

# Main program

account_id = "f062022"
client_id = "francisco"

account = Account(account_id, client_id)

amount = int(input("Hi " + client_id + ", write the amount to deposit in your account: "))

account.deposit(amount)
account.check_balance()
